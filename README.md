# UtilityBelt
UtilityBelt is a multipurpose decal plugin. Currently it has the following "modules".
- [AutoVendor](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/AutoVendor) - Automatically buy/sell based on a vtank loot profile when using a vendor.
- [AutoSalvage](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/AutoSalvage) - Automatically salvage items in your inventory that match salvage rules from the currently loaded vtank loot profile.
- [DungeonMaps](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/DungeonMaps) - Shows a map of the current dungeon on your screen.
- [EmuConfig](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/EmuConfig) - Helper UI for reading/setting client config options on GDLE servers.
- [ItemGiver](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/ItemGiver) - Command to give items matching a utl loot profile to a player/npc.
- [QuestTracker](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/QuestTracker) - Shows quest timers.
- [VisualNav](https://gitlab.com/trevis/utilitybelt/wikis/VisualNav) - Shows VTank nav route visually (like vi2 blue lines).

## Known Issues
* VirindiHotkeySystem will throw an error when changing emuconfig options. (If you don't use VHS just disable it in decal)
* Requires vtank to be installed (for autosalvage and autovendor, todo: make it fail gracefully)
* Visual Nav Routes only works on routes loaded via profile. [None] and routes embedded from a meta do not currently show.
